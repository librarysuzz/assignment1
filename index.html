<h1>Assignment 1 : My Profile<h1>
<h2> Personal Information</h2>
<p>My name in Suzette Hefford I am forty-seven years old. I was born in Canberra ACT and travelled around with my family as my father held multiple jobs while I was growing up. I recently completed a Bachelor of Library and Information Management. This was an effort as I was juggling full time work and my family. I currently work as a Senior Library Officer at my local library in Murray Bridge South Australia. I found that after working a full day of work I have found I quite enjoy cooking.</P>
<h3>What is your interest in I T? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
<p>My interest in IT has always been there. When I went to high school, I really enjoyed learning all about new technology. Back then we were still using DOS based systems with dot matrix printers. It was not until I entered the workforce that I was able to see just how much technology can help, from a basic word processor to using the first iteration of Word.</p>
