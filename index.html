<h1>Assignment 1 : My Profile<h1>

<hr />
<h2> Personal Information</h2>
<p>My name in Suzette Hefford I am forty-seven years old. I was born in Canberra ACT and travelled around with my family as my father held multiple jobs while I was growing up. I recently completed a Bachelor of Library and Information Management. This was an effort as I was juggling full time work and my family. I currently work as a Senior Library Officer at my local library in Murray Bridge South Australia. I found that after working a full day of work I have found I quite enjoy cooking.</P>
<h3>What is your interest in I T? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
<p>My interest in IT has always been there. When I went to high school, I really enjoyed learning all about new technology. Back then we were still using DOS based systems with dot matrix printers. It was not until I entered the workforce that I was able to see just how much technology can help, from a basic word processor to using the first iteration of Word.</p>
<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
<p>When I got my first job, I remember being so excited to get my first mobile phone (a Nokia), I was amazed by all the things it could do. From this point my interest in IT has grown. Now in my current job as a Senior Library Officer I help, particularly, seniors with their IT problems. This role will only increase as my Library has access to a grant. I have found that I am particularly showing my ‘student’ how to use their phones, and social media. </p>
<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>I was using Open University to find a course, I really wanted to complete something that was technology based. So by a process of looking at what was available I was able to limit my choices to RMIT. I have heard a lot of good things about RMIT. </p>
<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p>I am hoping that I will be able to learn more about technology. Especially around areas such as programming that I do not have a lot of knowledge in. I am also hoping that I can use this course to further my existing employment opportunities.</p>
<h2> Ideal Job</h2>
<p>My ideal job would be Senior Project Manager</p>

<h3>Job Description</h3>
<p>This job requires the successful applicant to be able to lead a team to complete approved IT projects on time and in budget. This would involve engaging with various stakeholders both externally and internally to ensure that change management is undertaken effectively. Identifying risks, provide regular reporting on the progress of all IT projects. All the while ensuring that compliance with all Australian and international legislation and standards is followed. Overall, this position requires a successful applicant to be able to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>I find this position appealing as I would be able to manage a team, engage with stakeholders and still be involved in IT. This position would enable me to follow a project through from beginning to end. I would also like the challenge of delivering a project on time and in budget.</p>
